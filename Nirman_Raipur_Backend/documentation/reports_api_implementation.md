### 4. Pending Works Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/pending`

- **Features**:
  - Lists all pending works across different stages
  - Includes pending technical, administrative, tender, and work order stages
  - Status breakdown and agency-wise pending analysis
  - Financial impact of pending works

### 5. Final Status Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/final-status`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `year` (optional): Filter by year (2000-2100)
- **Features**:
  - Work distribution by final status with percentages
  - Categorized into Pending, In Progress, and Completed
  - Detailed status breakdown with financial amounts
  - Summary statistics with category-wise grouping

### 6. Engineer-wise Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/engineer-wise`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `year` (optional): Filter by year (2000-2100)
  - `engineer` (optional): Filter by specific engineer name
- **Features**:
  - Statistics on works assigned to different engineers
  - Performance metrics including completion rates
  - Workload distribution and financial responsibility
  - Department, area, and scheme diversity

### 7. Photo Missing Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/photo-missing`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `year` (optional): Filter by year (2000-2100)
- **Features**:
  - Identifies works without location or progress photos
  - Separate tracking for location images and progress images
  - Status and agency breakdown of missing photos
  - Percentage of works without proper documentation

## Common Features

### Authentication
- All routes protected by `auth` middleware
- Secure access control for sensitive report data

### Validation
- Input validation for all query parameters
- Year validation (2000-2100 range)
- String validation for filter parameters
- Proper error handling for validation failures

### Standardized Response Format
- Consistent response structure across all APIs
- Success/error indicators
- Data payload with detailed information
- Summary section with key metrics
- Report generation timestamp
- Year filter information

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- Validation error responses with detailed error arrays
- Server error handling with proper logging
- HTTP status codes following REST conventions

### Data Sources
- Primary data source: WorkProposal model (main work tracking)
- Includes embedded schemas for technical approval, administrative approval, tender process, work orders, and work progress
- Cross-references with User model for population
- Year filtering based on submission date

### Performance Optimizations
- MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient data processing
- Proper indexing strategy on filtered fields
- Limited result sets where appropriate
- Optimized queries to prevent performance issues

## Response Structure Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...], // Array of report data
  "summary": {
    "totalItems": 150,
    "totalAmount": 50000000,
    "additionalMetrics": "...",
    "reportYear": "2024",
    "generatedAt": "2025-08-24T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Get agency-wise report for 2024
```
GET /api/reports/agency-wise?year=2024
```

### Get pending works for a specific agency
```
GET /api/reports/pending?agency=Public%20Works%20Department
```

### Get engineer performance report
```
GET /api/reports/engineer-wise?year=2024&engineer=John%20Smith
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all APIs with and without query parameters
2. Verify authentication by testing without auth token
3. Test validation by sending invalid year values
4. Check response format consistency
5. Verify aggregation accuracy with known test data
6. Test performance with large datasets

## Notes

- All APIs use the WorkProposal model as the primary data source
- Year filtering is based on `submissionDate` field
- Geographic filtering uses the `city` field for block-wise reports
- Engineer assignments use the `appointedEngineer` field
- Photo tracking checks both `workLocationImage` and `workProgress.progressImages` arrays
